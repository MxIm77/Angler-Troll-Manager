A simple Python Script you can run on anybody's computer to mess with them
                                                                          NOTE:
                                                                          
this script is still under production and I am working on making it a fully functional script creator whcih is supported for both MacOs and WindowsOs and all you will have to do is to run the .py file that will be generated

                                                                          HOW TO ?
---> this script when executed places a .bat file withing the startup directory of windows which causes the computer to shutdown 30 seconds after startup and shows a message of "This computer has ran into an error"


====> MAKE SURE YOU RUN THIS ON YOUR TARGETS COMPUTER AND NOT YOUR'S IF YOU NEED TO RECOVER GO TO "{%APPDATA%}\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\" AND REMOVE THE 'run.bat' FILE
